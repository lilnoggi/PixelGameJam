> If you're contributing, **pull before working**, and **push after closing Unity** to avoid merge conflicts!

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the folder with Unity Hub  
3. Use Unity **2022.3.x LTS**
4. Make magic ✨

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Assets/Scripts/` → C# scripts
- `Assets/Art/Characters/` → Player and enemy sprites (PNG only)
- `Assets/Art/Environments/` → Backgrounds, props, etc.
- `Assets/Audio/Music/` → MP3/OGG for background music
- `Assets/Audio/SFX/` → Sound effects (WAV or MP3)
- `Assets/Scenes/` → Unity scenes

---

## 🛠️ Git & Collaboration Notes

- `.gitignore` is set up to avoid committing temp/auto-generated Unity files
- Please communicate any major file restructures
- Avoid committing `.csproj`, `.sln`, `Library/`, `Temp/`, etc.
- Use **branches** for big features if needed, or just work off `main` for speed

---

## 🎨 How to Upload Art & Music Files

> 📝 Please **DO NOT upload files directly to `main`** unless it's a small fix. Instead:

1. **Fork** the repo or create a **branch** like `art-assets`, `music-drop`, or `feature/player-light`
2. Place files in the correct folders (see structure above)
3. Open a **Pull Request** to merge into `main` and add a short description (e.g. “Added new player walk animation”)

**Accepted file types:**
- PNG (pixel art, transparent background)
- MP3 / WAV / OGG (audio)

---

## ▶️ How to Open the Project in Unity

2. Open Unity Hub → Add Project → Select this folder
